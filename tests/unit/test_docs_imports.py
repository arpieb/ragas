"""Every ``ragas`` import shown in the docs must actually resolve.

Documentation drifts silently: a module is renamed or removed, and the pages
that import it keep rendering perfectly while their code samples stop working.
Nothing catches it -- `mkdocs build --strict` validates links between pages, not
Python inside fenced blocks.

Three were found this way, all in pages that were live in the sidebar:

  ragas.metrics.critique               removed; in the Langfuse integration page
  ragas.testset.synthesizers.base_query  never existed; in a Core Concepts page,
                                         subclassing a QuerySynthesizer that
                                         does not exist either
  ragas.integrations.griptape          imports, but its ImportError told the
                                       reader to `pip install opik`

This walks the docs, extracts every `ragas`-rooted import, and imports it.
