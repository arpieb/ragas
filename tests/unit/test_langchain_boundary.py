"""Guard rails for the LangChain removal.

These tests ratchet: the numbers and sets below may only ever shrink. They exist so
that a stage of the migration cannot silently regress, and so that the remaining
work is visible as a number rather than a vibe.

The companion enforcement is ruff's ``TID251`` banned-api rule in ``pyproject.toml``,
which bans importing langchain anywhere and lists the files still doing so under
``[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]``. That list must only shrink too.

See the migration plan for the staged approach.
